## My Process

I've come across a lot of different ways to create a simple To-DON'T list. Here I worked with the simplest approach from a Youtube tutorial that simply created an element and then
placed it into of a div. The javascript is straight forward. I did have a bug where if you double clicked on an item you wanted to delete, it would delete the most bottom item,
regardless of whether or not you actually clicked it. However, the problem seemed to have resolved itself and I have no idea what initially caused it to act in that way.
I used Bootstrap to create a more aesthetically pleasing look and added media queries for responsiveness. Overall, I'm happy with the simply look and functionality of this project.

### Built With

- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Javascipt
- Flexbox

### Continued Development

I'm getting slightly better at using Bootstrap, but I am interested in expanding into Tailwind CSS sometime in the future. I also would like to expand on this app at some point
so that the functionality is more straightforward, such as adding a delete button next to each item that users can click to get rid of the items, as well as a check mark bubble
next to each item that users can click on when they are done with a task.
